Summary for the Visual-SLAM
I think the SLAM system operates according to the following key steps:
1. Map initialization
First map initialization using two frames is used to build the 3D point map.
The geometric relationships between these frames are determined based on ORB feature matching using homography and fundamental matrices.
Apply s-triangulation to generate 3D world points.
2. Tracking
This script estimates the camera pose by matching features in new frames to features in the last keyframe using ORB features.
It refines camera pose estimation by tracking local map points and performing motion-only bundle adjustments.
3. Local mapping
New keyframes are added, local mapping refines the keyframe's pose and map points are updated using local bundle adjustments.
It ensures robust mapping by considering observations across multiple keyframes and effectively managing outliers.
4. Loop closure
Using a loop closing mechanism, errors accumulated over time are corrected by detecting revisited scenes. This step involves creating and querying a feature bag model to identify previously visited locations.
