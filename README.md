Visual SLAM Project Overview:

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) stands as a pivotal method extensively employed in the domain of autonomous vehicles, facilitating the concurrent construction of maps and localization of the vehicle within those maps. These algorithms empower vehicles to navigate and map out uncharted territories, providing engineers with vital map information essential for tasks such as path planning and obstacle avoidance.

Initiating this project, the first step entails leveraging the dataset sourced from the TUM RGB-D benchmark to execute a test model for SLAM. Detailed insights and outcomes of this initial phase are meticulously documented within the "Step1" folder.

Moving forward to step 2, the project trajectory shifts towards the creation of a bespoke dataset capturing a scene of personal preference. Comprehensive documentation and outcomes pertaining to this phase are encapsulated within the "Step2" folder.
