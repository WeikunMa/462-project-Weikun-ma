step2 plan
I planned to shoot a short video first. To ensure smoothness and clarity, I personally felt that it had to be shot in a bright environment, so I chose the gym as the location. Then because I am not very good at using matlab to query the resolution and details of the device I used to shoot the video. So I decided to use the potplayer software to take frame-by-frame screenshots and adjust the photo resolution to the same resolution of 640*480 as in step 1. At the same time, I reduced the video quality to 60%, and then gradually ran the code of step 1 and slowly modified it if there were any errors.
